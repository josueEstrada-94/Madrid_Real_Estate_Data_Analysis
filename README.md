# Madrid Rental Data Analysis Project
# Context
A real estate investment company has initiated a data exploration project with the aim of identifying the most promising apartments for acquisition in Madrid, Spain. The project will leverage data analysis techniques to assess potential properties based on the following key factors:

* Location: Analyzing the geographical location of apartments to identify neighborhoods with high demand and growth potential.

* Occupancy Rate: Evaluating the current occupancy rates of apartments to gauge their income-generating potential.

* Rental Price: Scrutinizing rental prices to ensure the company can achieve a desirable return on investment.

* Buying Price: Assessing the purchase prices of apartments to identify cost-effective opportunities for acquisition.

Through data exploration, this project will enable the company to make informed decisions about which properties to buy, with a focus on maximizing profitability and long-term returns.

# Insights (The process and the code used to lead to these insights are in the notebooks)

Insight 1: Some properties may have a moderate base price but experience increased demand and higher prices during sports events or shows throughout the year.

Insight 2: The number of beds to avoid is 2. There are more expensive than the other properties based on the number of beds.

Insight 3: The optimal number of guests is 3, as the price of properties to accommodate 3 is the same as accommodating 1 or 2. Beyond 4, the floor space needs to be larger, and the purchase price increases significantly.

Insight 4: It appears that proximity to points of interest doesn't have as much impact as it would be expected. This opens the door to search for properties in a central district that are not right next to the Point of Interest (Puerta del Sol), and therefore, they are expected to have a lower purchase price.

Insight 5: There is not a strong correlation between the occupancy rate and the proximity to 'La Puerta del Sol' as 'Barajas' is located too far from the key location. However, this district could be a key point due to the proximity to the Madrid Airport and its high occupancy rate.

Insight 6: There are still many yellow and orange points, which may indicate that there is still potential to further exploit the factor of sporting events. These yellow and orange points refer to properties with low costs, which can potentially offer a better profit margin.
